Today the recipe is still unchanged, just break a very fresh egg into a glass, beat it with sugar, and add coffee or hot milk, for children, or Marsala wine or aniseed for adults. This marvelous cream gave rise to mascarpone cream used to make Tiramisù (mascarpone cheese and ladyfingers dessert). This is the best Italian dessert, the most popular and beloved of them all, and it has also birthed many other versions, even an egg-free Tiramisù! There is also a strawberry and Nutella tiramisù! Although the origins of this famous dessert are unclear, because it is disputed between the regions of Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Piedmont, and Tuscany, it remains a cornerstone of Italian cuisine and it's widely prepared from North to South. Unfortunately, we weren't able to find out who invented it, but we can certainly teach you how to prepare your best tiramisù ever. So here's the recipe: try it and let us know what you think!",

Peel the avocado, then cut lengthwise into 1/3-inch thick slices. For the wide center slices, lay them flat and cut into 1/3-inch wide sticks so that they are shaped like the cucumber sticks.",

Place a sheet of nori with a long side lined up with the bottom edge of the mat. With dampened hands, place 1/6 (scant 2/3 cup) of the rice on the nori and press into an even layer to the edges.",

            "10 ": "Add the filling to the nori side. Open the mat up again. Lay 2 crabsticks across the middle of the nori. Place a row of cucumber sticks next to the crabsticks (trim them as needed to fit). Top the crabsticks with avocado slices, trimming as needed to fit.",
            "11": "Roll the sushi. Lift up the bottom edge of the mat and roll until the top and bottom of the nori are touching and the mat is completely wrapped over the sushi roll.",
            "12 ": "Mold the sushi. While holding the mat over the sushi roll in place, gently pull the top of the mat to pull it taut. Gently squeeze along the length of the roll so that it holds together.",
            "13": "Shape the sushi if needed. Unroll the mat. Check the sushi roll. If it is not perfectly round, fold the mat over the roll and gently shape it into a round shape.",
            "14": "Repeat rolling. Transfer the sushi to a plate seam-side down. If there is any rice stuck to the bamboo mat, remove it before making the next sushi roll. Roll the remaining pieces of nori, you may have some cucumber and avocado left.",
            "15": "Cut each roll into 6 pieces. Cut the sushi rolls with a damp knife — a very sharp chef's knife or serrated knife works best. For each roll, cut it in half crosswise. Place the two pieces next to each other and cut twice more so that you end up with 6 pieces. Turn the pieces so that they are cut side up. For the best presentation, place the two end pieces in the middle.",
            "16": "Serve the sushi. The sushi is best served within an hour or two, so keep covered in plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out if not serving immediately. Serve with wasabi, pickled ginger, and soy sauce or tamari for dipping."
