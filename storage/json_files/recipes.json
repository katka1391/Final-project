Remove from the heat and let steam, covered, for 15 minutes. (Alternatively, cook the rice in a rice cooker.) Meanwhile, prepare the vinegar seasoning and fillings." },

Microwave the vinegar, sugar, and salt together in a small microwave-safe bowl in 15-second bursts, stirring between bursts, until warm to the touch and the sugar and salt are dissolved, 1 to 2 bursts.

Drizzle with the vinegar mixture and fold it in with a rubber spatula until thoroughly combined and cooled to room temperature. You can speed up the process by fanning it while folding." },
            { "stepNumber": "Top the nori with rice. Have a small bowl of water for dampening hands handy. Place a bamboo sushi mat on a work surface with the slats running from side to side.

            { "stepNumber": "Add the filling to the nori side. Open the mat up again. Lay 2 crabsticks across the middle of the nori. Place a row of cucumber sticks next to the crabsticks (trim them as needed to fit). Top the crabsticks with avocado slices, trimming as needed to fit." },
            { "stepNumber": "Roll the sushi. Lift up the bottom edge of the mat and roll until the top and bottom of the nori are touching and the mat is completely wrapped over the sushi roll." },
            { "stepNumber": "Mold the sushi. While holding the mat over the sushi roll in place, gently pull the top of the mat to pull it taut. Gently squeeze along the length of the roll so that it holds together." },

            { "stepNumber": "Cut each roll into 6 pieces. Cut the sushi rolls with a damp knife — a very sharp chef's knife or serrated knife works best. For each roll, cut it in half crosswise. Place the two pieces next to each other and cut twice more so that you end up with 6 pieces. Turn the pieces so that they are cut side up. For the best presentation, place the two end pieces in the middle." },

Repeat until all the batter is used up.        " },
