            <q>Sourdough is naturally leavened bread, which means it doesn’t use 
                commercial yeast to rise. Instead, it uses a ‘starter’ – a fermented 
                flour and water mixture that contains wild yeast and good bacteria 
                – to rise. This also produces the tangy flavour and slightly chewy 
                texture you’ll find in sourdough. Wild yeast has more flavour than 
                commercial yeast, and is natural in the sense that it doesn’t contain
                any additives.Basic sourdough is made from nothing more than flour, water and 
              salt – here’s what you need to know about each.
              Flour – sourdough can be made with many types of flour, but for
              our basic recipe, we’ll be using strong white bread flour. It’s 
              the most readily available, and means you’ll only need to buy 
              one flour to start. But, we know ingredients are hard to come 
              by at the moment, so you can also use strong wholemeal 
              bread flour.</q>

                <q> Water – good old tap water is absolutely fine, and it’s the only thing we’ve ever used to make our sourdough. Don’t waste money on minerals. Salt – fine, pure sea salt is the best, but if you don’t have it, you can use any type of cooking
                    salt you have, except rock salt – that will need to be crushed before using. You can use different flours in our basic recipe without changing the amount of water you use or the method in any way, other than adding less strong white
                    bread flour. Here are the ideal proportions: For wholemeal, granary, seeded or malted flour use 350g strong white bread flour and 150g of the other flour so you still have 500g total. For rye, spelt, emmer, buckwheat or Khorasan flour
                    use 400g strong white bread flour and 100g of the other flour so you still have 500g total. You can experiment with different proportions, but bear in mind that other flours will be ‘thirstier’, so you’ll then need to adjust the amount
                    of water accordingly. But once you know what texture you’re looking for in the dough, this will be easy to do. The basic dough is a blank canvas to which you can add anything you like. Flavouring ingredients should be scattered over
                    the dough, or worked into it during the final two folds. We’ve added seeds, nuts, grains, olives, herbs, chillies, chunks of cheese and dried fruit to our sourdough.</p>

           <h3 style=" margin: 0;">How to score sourdough</h3>
           <q> 
            The original starter will take four or five days or possibly longer to make, but it only requires a few minutes of your time each day. Once it’s active, you’ll be able to use it again and again to make bread, as long as you keep feeding it. We’ve used strong white bread flour for ease, but many recipes will recommend starting with wholemeal, rye or a mixture of white and wholemeal – whichever you choose, the method is still exactly the same.   
            If you’re only making simple slashes in your loaves, there’s no need to buy a lame. But, if you want to make fancier patterns, you’ll need one.
            To make the scored pattern stand out, first dust the loaf with flour using a small sieve.
            The bread needs to be able to expand somewhere, and you need to control where this happens or it will ruin your design. A series of big slashes, like a criss-cross design, will allow this. But, if you’re doing a more intricate pattern, you’ll need to balance it with a big score somewhere, often down one side.
            Where you want the bread to expand and open a lot, hold the lame or knife at a 45-degree angle while scoring. This will give you the trademark ‘ear’ shape. Where you want the bread to expand just a little, slash the bread straight down.</q>
