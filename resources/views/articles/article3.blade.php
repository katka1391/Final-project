        <q>Now that you know how to choose the perfect Halloween pumpkin 
            for carving, here are some tips to get the job done!
            If you plan to use battery-powered lights in your jack-o-lantern, 
            carve a circle out of the bottom to preserve the top. For candles or 
            tealights, cut a hole in the top. Make sure you buy a pumpkin with a
            stem. A thick, green stem works best and indicates the pumpkin 
            has thick walls as well. Don’t be afraid to pick oddly shaped 
            pumpkins. Depending on your design, the weirder the shape, the 
            more unique design you can create. Scoop out as much of the 
            pumpkin guts as possible. The thinner the walls, the longer your 
            pumpkin will last. This will also help to delay mold growth. 
            Research design ideas before you start carving! This prevents 
            mistakes and allows you to sketch out the design onto the pumpkin 
            before you begin.</q>

            <q> Pumpkins are packed with skin-friendly nutrients, including vitamins C and E, as well as beta-carotene, all of which play an important role in the health of our skin.

                Vitamin C is not naturally made by the body, so it’s important we get it from our diet, as it plays a part in the formation of collagen which keeps skin plump and firm, vitamin C also helps prevent bruising and promotes wound healing.
                
                Vitamin E is an excellent antioxidant and works with vitamin C to help protect against sun damage and dryness. Vitamin A, or beta-carotene, is also involved in skin protection from the sun’s UVB rays and may help protect against sunburn, although sunscreen is still needed!.
                Low levels of vitamin A has been linked with reduced vision and even blindness. Beta-carotene, as well as vitamins C and E, help protect eyes and reduce the risk of age-related eye diseases. Pumpkin is also an excellent source of two carotenoids called lutein and zeaxanthin, levels of which have been linked to a reduced risk of cataracts.
                As indicated by their bright orange colour, pumpkins contain beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A when consumed. Research has demonstrated that vitamin A plays an important role in promoting immune function. Vitamin C also contributes to immune activity facilitating immune cell activity and increasing white blood cells.</p>
