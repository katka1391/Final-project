           <h3> Pumpkin Carving Tips and Tricks</h3>
           <q>Now that you know how to choose the perfect Halloween pumpkin 
            for carving, here are some tips to get the job done!
            If you plan to use battery-powered lights in your jack-o-lantern, 
            carve a circle out of the bottom to preserve the top. For candles or 
            tealights, cut a hole in the top. Make sure you buy a pumpkin with a
            stem. A thick, green stem works best and indicates the pumpkin 
            has thick walls as well. Don’t be afraid to pick oddly shaped 
            pumpkins. Depending on your design, the weirder the shape, the 
            more unique design you can create. Scoop out as much of the 
            pumpkin guts as possible. The thinner the walls, the longer your 
            pumpkin will last. This will also help to delay mold growth. 
            Research design ideas before you start carving! This prevents 
            mistakes and allows you to sketch out the design onto the pumpkin 
            before you begin.

           <div class="border-left"><q> The easiest way to use a pre-made pattern or design you printed 
            onto paper is to first tape the paper onto the face of the pumpkin. 
            Then use a fork, pencil, or needle tool to poke holes along the lines 
            you want to cut out. Pumpkins don’t last forever. For the best-
            looking jack-o-lantern on the block, carve your pumpkin no more 
            than two to three days prior to your event or Halloween party. 
            Light up your jack-o-lantern using an LED or CFL light. Other types
            of lights, as well as candles, give off heat that can cook the pumpkin
            form the inside, shortening its lifespan.
            Make rough design cuts first to remove large pieces from the 
            gourd. Once you the basics carved out, you can then go back and 
            clean up the design or add additional details. When cutting your 
            pumpkin with a knife, use clean up-and-down slices. You want to 
            avoid making cuts on a slant. Keep your pumpkin scraps to create 
            additional design elements for your Halloween jack-o-lantern. You 
            can use these pieces to cut out a tongue, hair accessories, or other 
            features from leftover chunks of pumpkin shell. Save your seeds! 
            Pepitas, or pumpkin seeds, are delicious when seasoned and 
            roasted.</q>

           <h3 style=" margin: 0;">Health benefits of pumpkin</h3>
           <q> Pumpkins are packed with skin-friendly nutrients, including vitamins C and E, as well as beta-carotene, all of which play an important role in the health of our skin.

            Vitamin C is not naturally made by the body, so it’s important we get it from our diet, as it plays a part in the formation of collagen which keeps skin plump and firm, vitamin C also helps prevent bruising and promotes wound healing.
            
            Vitamin E is an excellent antioxidant and works with vitamin C to help protect against sun damage and dryness. Vitamin A, or beta-carotene, is also involved in skin protection from the sun’s UVB rays and may help protect against sunburn, although sunscreen is still needed!.</q>
            Low levels of vitamin A has been linked with reduced vision and even blindness. Beta-carotene, as well as vitamins C and E, help protect eyes and reduce the risk of age-related eye diseases. Pumpkin is also an excellent source of two carotenoids called lutein and zeaxanthin, levels of which have been linked to a reduced risk of cataracts.
            As indicated by their bright orange colour, pumpkins contain beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A when consumed. Research has demonstrated that vitamin A plays an important role in promoting immune function. Vitamin C also contributes to immune activity facilitating immune cell activity and increasing white blood cells.
